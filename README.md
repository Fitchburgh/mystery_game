# Mystery Game

## To Run :
``` rb
$ ruby mystery_word.rb
```
## To Play :  
Enter which mode you would like to play: Easy, Normal, or Hard. If you enter any other value, you will be prompted to select only Easy, Normal, or Hard.

Once you select your level, a random word will be chosen and hidden from you. The computer will share how many letters your word contains. You have 8 guesses to complete the word.

To start guessing, simply enter a letter you believe is in that word. If you are correct, the word will update to reveal where those letters go. If you are wrong, you will get an alert about how many guesses you have left.

Duplicate letter guesses do not count as turns.

Once you've either completed the word or failed, the game will ask if you would like to play again with a new word.
